# NES Adapter

Code for Arduino Micro (or similar) boards to use an old NES controller as a USB gamepad.

This project uses the [Arduino Joystick library](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary), so make sure that it is installed before compiling.

The code was tested with the EU version of the controller. For pinout information, visit the [NES wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Controller_port_pinout).
